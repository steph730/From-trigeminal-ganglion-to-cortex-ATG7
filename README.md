# From trigeminal ganglion to cortex - ATG7

This study employs a multi-omics approach to delineate the molecular pathways of migraine, spanning from the peripheral trigeminal ganglion to the central cortex. Through integrative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, we identified ATG7 as a critical hub gene, implicating autophagy and other key cellular processes in migraine pathophysiology.

This code repository provides the computational framework to reproduce our findings, from raw data preprocessing to the generation of key insights.
